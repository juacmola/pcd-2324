## Introduction
This repository contains the exercises of the course of Concurrent and Distributed Programming. The course is part of the Degree of Computer Science of the University of Murcia (Universidad de Murcia). This course is being taught in the second semester of the second year of the degree. In this case, our participation in the course was in the academic year 2023/2024. The course was taught by the professor Sergio LÃ³pez Bernal ([LinkedIn](#https://www.linkedin.com/in/slopezbernal/?originalSubdomain=es)) ([Investigation Web](#https://portalinvestigacion.um.es/investigadores/815441/detalle)).

The project is divided into four exercises. We attached both the code and the report of each exercise. As you can see, we have used the Java programming language to solve the exercises.

The reports and the code comments are written in Spanish. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
